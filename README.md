# University-Recommender-System
I built a University Recommender System using Content-Based Filtering

This repository contains code for building a university recommender system using Python. The recommender system utilizes cosine similarity to recommend universities based on their overall scores, teaching scores, research scores, citations, number of students, student-staff ratio, and international student percentage.

Files:

university_recommender.py: Python script containing the code for the university recommender system.

TIMES_WorldUniversityRankings_2024.csv: Sample dataset containing university ranking data obtained from Kaggle.

Requirements:

Python 3.x
pandas
scikit-learn

How to Use:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the university_recommender.py script.

Usage:

Modify the university_recommender.py script to adjust the recommender system according to your requirements.
Replace the sample dataset (TIMES_WorldUniversityRankings_2024.csv) with your own dataset if needed.
Execute the script and observe the recommended universities based on the input university.
